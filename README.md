# boatProject
This is a project to create a boat from the scratch where i was responsible of making the code, the point of the code it's to control the boat with the smartphone with a joystick. The final code it's "Boatproject.ino" however this will only work in a presence of a arduino with WIFI module, so to test it without any arduino components run the "index.html" code. Sadly i lost this version of the controller where you have the speed and battery levels because i had to implament it with a current sensor and my time on the project was short. I putted another code of the initial idea of this project with the name "firstVersion" too feel free to see.
